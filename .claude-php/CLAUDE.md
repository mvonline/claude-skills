### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY not-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for a project

### 3. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 4. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes. Don't overengineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 5. Skills usage
- Use skills for any task that requires a capability
- Load skills from `.claude-php/skills/`
- Invoke skills with natural language
- Each skill is one independent capability

### 6. Subagents usage
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Load subagents from `.claude-php/agents/`
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution on a given tech stack

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards

## Project General Instructions

- Always use the latest versions of PHP and Laravel.
- Always write PHP code as the Laravel application.
- Always use Composer for dependency management.
- Always create test cases for the generated code (PHPUnit or Pest).
- Always generate a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).
- Minimize the amount of code generated.
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
- Use type hinting and strict types in PHP.
- Generate the Docker Compose file to run all components used by the application.
- Update README.md each time you generate a new version.
